## How to call my contract's function using sendTransaction

- 摘自[how-to-call-my-contracts-function-using-sendtransaction](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/8736/how-to-call-my-contracts-function-using-sendtransaction) 

#### Code

```

var contractAbi = eth.contract(AbiOfContract);
var myContract = contractAbi.at(contractAddress);
// suppose you want to call a function named myFunction of myContract
var getData = myContract.myFunction.getData(function parameters);
//finally paas this data parameter to send Transaction
web3.eth.sendTransaction({to:Contractaddress, from:Accountaddress, data: getData});

```

- You need not implement getData method.It is used to retrieve the value of data in state storage. You can read more here: [contracts.html#visibility-and-getters](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html#visibility-and-getters)

## What is "data" param of rawTx? How to send ETH by using web3.eth.sendRawTransaction

- 摘自[what-is-quot-data-quot-param-of-rawtx-how-to-send-eth-by-using-web3](https://www.questarter.com/q/what-is-quot-data-quot-param-of-rawtx-how-to-send-eth-by-using-web3-29_21324.html)
- 起因是要查 sendRawTransaction intrinsic gas too low
- 文档[web3ethsendrawtransaction](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethsendrawtransaction)

```

var Tx = require('ethereumjs-tx');

const privateStr = '账号私钥字符串';
var privateKey = new Buffer(privateStr, 'hex');

var rawTx = {
    chainId: web3.toHex('my chainId'), //私链的networkid和chainId保持一致
    nonce: '0x1001', //transaction number personal
    gas:  web3.toHex("21000"),
    gasPrice: web3.toHex(web3.eth.gasPrice.toNumber()), 
    gasLimit: web3.toHex(40000),
    from:   '0xFrom',
    to: '0xTo', 
    value: web3.toHex( web3.toWei("0.05",'ether') )
};

var tx = new Tx(rawTx);
tx.sign(privateKey);

var serializedTx = tx.serialize();

web3.eth.sendRawTransaction('0x' + serializedTx.toString('hex'), function(err, hash) {
    if (!err){
        console.log(hash);
    } else {
        console.error(err);
    }
});

```
#### Answer 1
To just send ETH, set gasLimit to 21,000 and remove data (or set it to empty ''). The base fee of 21,000 gas assumes that to is not a contract.

If to is a contract and you wanted to invoke a function on to, you would set data according to the function you wanted to invoke and any arguments it needed. For this, the value of data would be encoded according to the ABI. Using web3.eth.estimateGas can help see how much gas is needed to execute the function and whatever functions it may also invoke.

data can also be used to simply store bytes on the blockchain. If to is not a contract, you can statically compute the fee (in addition to the base 21,000 gas) as 4 gas for a zero byte, 68 gas for non-zero byte.

#### Answer 2
Gas: For a transaction between two private-key controlled accounts (not sending to smart contract) costs 21000 gas. If you are sending a transaction to a smart contract that has some functionality, you have to pay for that functionality with gas. You can [estimate the gas costs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethestimategas) but keep in mind that it is not always possible to know the gas consumption prior to calling, so just give a high enough value. I recommend testing your entire contract on Remix first to get a feeling for the gas costs.

Data: You can send arbitrary data in all transactions. Keep in mind that sending data is fairly expensive (in gas!). Normally, when sending from one private key controlled account to another you keep this empty (default value). This data field is also used to tell a smart contract which function you are calling. The function signature is encoded in the first four bytes of the keccak hash of the function name including parameters.

## Error: insufficient funds for gas * price + value

- 摘自[error-insufficient-funds-for-gas-price-value](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/32901/error-insufficient-funds-for-gas-price-value)

## myContractInstance.myMethod.getData is not defined

- 摘自[truffle-contrace-issue-10](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-contract/issues/10)

```
there's now

yourContractInstance.yourMethod.request(yourMethodParams,..);
This will return something like:

{ method: 'eth_sendTransaction',
  callback: undefined,
  params:
   [ { to: '0x9538781810e67913f13a56b891452e3aa8dd3ea0',
       data: '0x1d834a1b00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001' } ],
  format: [Function: bound ] }

```

## web3 call contract method without unlock account

- 查看文档搜集资料测试研究出来的结果

```

let myContract = contInstance.getContractInstance('zoo');
    
// suppose you want to call a function named myFunction of myContract

let functionParams = {};

<!--external contract method-->
let getData = myContract.contractMethod.request(functionParams).params[0].data
/* getData
{ method: 'eth_sendTransaction',
  callback: undefined,
  params:
   [ { to: '0xd84b922494c3a39113052eb6cc4453b968ee69f7',
       data: '0xfbede92000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003ea' } ],
  format: [Function: bound ] }
*/  

let from = '0xFrom'; //from地址
let gas = 400000;
web3.eth.sendTransaction({from:from, data: getData,gasPrice:web3.eth.gasPrice,gas:gas});

```
